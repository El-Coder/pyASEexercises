# Exercise 2

_Goal:_ Create an HTTP POST request which posts your name and a message. Our web appllication expects a [JSON](https://www.json.org/) payload which, minimally, should include a 'name' and a 'message' property.

```json
{
    "name": "kevin",
    "message": "this is an example POST"
}
```
